"""
General rules held in this module:
- params ending with `_op` like `conv_op` or simply op require function layer -> layer, e.g. conv(128, f=...)
- params not ending with `_op` like `conv` require function with similar signature as
    layer/subnetwork with the same name. Such parameters allows to override layer/subnetwork used.
    For example, overriding default nonlinearity: conv=lambda num_filters: conv(num_filters, f=T.nnet.sigmoid).
- usually, module provides two similar implementations of the same subnetwork like
  fire and fire_block. Longer name = more flexibility but more parameters.
